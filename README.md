## 📌 Project Overview

This project is the final assignment for the Machine Learning course and consists of two main tasks:

1. **Classification Task:** Iris Flower Classification  
2. **Regression Task:** Life Expectancy Prediction (WHO Dataset)

The objective is to apply, compare, and analyze multiple machine learning models using proper preprocessing, visualization, evaluation metrics, and interpretation of results.

All implementations are done using **Google Colab**.
